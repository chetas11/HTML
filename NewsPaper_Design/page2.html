            Dhoni Among Cricket’s Greatest Captains: Greg Chappel
          </h3>

          <p>
            Charismatic Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the “most inspirational captain”
            of international cricket in the last 50 years, along with legends
            Englands Michael Brearley, Australians Ian Chappell and Mark Taylor,
            and Clive Lloyd of the West Indies, says Aussie great Greg Chappell
            in an Interview without mincing words. Clearly impressed by Dhoni’s
            game, Chappell, who was India coach during the first two years of
            Dhoni’s international career (2005-2007), also revealed that the
            wicket-keeper-batsman “exceeded” all his expectations and was “best
            Indian captain that I have seen”. He disclosed that he would throw
            many challenges at him and the Indian would love to live up to
            those, on way to becoming “one of the great all-rounders of his
            era”. On the lighter side, the legendary Aussie revealed that he
            enjoyed Dhoni’s “humour and cheeky manner”.

            Facebook purges 22.5M pieces of hate speech
          </h3>
          <p>
            Facebook on Tuesday said that it purged 22.5 million pieces of hate
            speech content in the second quarter (April-June) this year,
            increased from 9.6 million pieces of content in Q1, and its
            proactive detection rate for hate speech increased 6 points from 89
            per cent to 95 per cent. When it comes to fake accounts, Facebook
            said it removed 1,5 billion such accounts in Q2, down from 1.7
            billion accounts in Q1. The reason for the decline the social
            network gave was that when it blocks more attempts, there are fewer
            fake accounts for it to disable, “which has led to a general decline
            in accounts actioned since Q1 2019”.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We estimate that fake accounts represented approximately 5 per cent
            of our worldwide monthly active users (MAU) on Facebook during Q2,”
            Guy Rosen, VP Integrity at Facebook, said in a blog post detailing
            the sixth edition of ‘Community Standards Enforcement Report’. On
            Instagram, the proactive detection rate for hate speech increased 39
            points from 45 per cent to 84 per cent in the June quarter, said
            Facebook. It resulted in action on 3.3 million pieces of hate speech
            content in Q2, up from 808,900 in Q1.

            Second Largest Grand Apple Central World Opens In Thailand
          </h3>
          <p>
            Apple on Wednesday previewed its second and largest retail location
            in Thailand that will be thrown open to the public on July 31.
            Nestled in the heart of Ratchaprasong, Bangkok’s iconic

            brought to life with the first-ever all-glass design, housed under a
            cantilevered Tree Canopy roof. The new store will open with thorough
            health and safety measures in the Covid-19 times, including a mask
            requirement, temperature checks, and social distancing.

            COVID May Cause Delirium and Brain Issues
          </h3>
          <p>
            Covid-19 can cause severe neurological complications, including
            delirium, brain inflammation, stroke and nerve damage, warn
            researchers..
          </p>
          <p>
            Published in the journal Brain, the research team identified one
            rare and sometimes fatal inflammatory condition, known as ADEM,
            which appears to be increasing in prevalence due to the pandemic.
            Some patients in the study did not experience severe respiratory
            symptoms, and the neurological disorder was the first and main
            presentation of Covid-19, the researchers said. “We identified a
            higher than expected number of people with neurological conditions
            such as brain inflammation, which did not always correlate with the
            severity of respiratory symptoms.” said study senior author Dr
            Michael Zandi from the University College London (UCL) in the UK.
          </p>
          <p>
            The current study provides a detailed account of neurological
            symptoms of 43 people (aged 16-85) treated at the National Hospital
            for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH, who had either confirmed or
            suspected Covid-19.
