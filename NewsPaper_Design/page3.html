            The infamous North Korean Lazarus group is back and this time, the
            hackers belonging to the group are targeting cryptocurrency
            organisations by sending phishing emails via Microsoft-owned
            LinkedIn…reports India Daily News

                According to the researchers at global cybersecurity firm
                F-Secure, a system administrator from the target organization
                received a phishing document via their personal LinkedIn
                account. “The document masqueraded as a legitimate job advert
                for a role in a blockchain technology company that matched the
                employee’s skills,” F-Secure said in a statement. Though the
                document on the target’s host had been altered to remove
                malicious content after execution, F-Secure assessed that the
                original document was the same, or similar to, a sample publicly
                available on internet security website VirusTotal. According to
                data by VirusTotal, the original malicious content was created
                in 2019. In 2019, F-Secure uncovered technical details on
                Lazarus Group’s modus operandi during an investigation of an
                attack on an organisation in the cryptocurrency vertical.
                “Lazarus Group’s activities are a continued threat: the phishing
                campaign associated with this attack has been observed,

                continuing into 2020, raising the need for awareness and ongoing
                vigilance among organisations operating in the targeted
                verticals,” the cybersecurity firm said. Earlier this year, the
                hacker group stole cryptocurrency from Mac and Windows users.
                Lazarus was also involved in stealing nearly $600 million worth
                of crypto between 2017 and 2018. “There is evidence in recent
                reporting of Lazarus Group leveraging similar techniques to
                those observed in this campaign, such as the preference of
                LinkedIn as a delivery medium, to compromise organisations in
                other verticals,” F-Secure said. “It is F-Secure’s assessment
                that the group will continue to target organisations within the
                cryptocurrency vertical while it remains such a profitable
                pursuit, but may also expand to target supply chain elements of
                the vertical to increase returns and longevity of the campaign”.
                In July this year, reports surfaced that North Korea-based
                hackers have engaged in a large scale digital skimming activity.

            Foundation supported by Whatsapp, Twitter, UNICEF officially
            announced the launch of an online ‘eRaksha Competition 2020’ in June

            on online safety and cyber security to facilitate a peaceful,

            While the whole agenda is still speculative, a live demonstration of
            neuron firing activity is confirmed. “Will show neurons firing in
            real-time on August 28th. The matrix in the matrix,” Musk tweeted
            last month. Musk has also claimed that a new Neuralink chip will
            allow users to hear sounds that previously were impossible to human
            ears. He confirmed the new feature last month over an exchange with
            a Twitter user who asked: “If we implement Neuralink – can we listen
            to music directly from our chips? Great feature.” Musk replied with
            a simple, “yes”. He also confirmed that the chip would be able to
            control hormone levels, which would have the potential to help with
            anxiety relief, among other things. To help paralysed people control
            devices and empower people with brain disorders, Neuralink last year
            unveiled tiny brain “threads” in a chip which is long-lasting,
            usable at home and has the potential to replace cumbersome devices
            currently used as brain-machine interfaces.

            year. It’s awesome,”

            The technology has a module that sits outside the head, behind the
            ear, and receives information from “threads” embedded in the brain.
            Controlled by an iPhone app, the chip called “N1 sensor” with just a
            USB port coming out can have as many as 3,072 electrodes per array
            distributed across 96 “threads” — each “thread” smaller than the
            tiniest human hair. The chip which will be wireless in the future
            can read, transmit high-volume data and amplify signals from the
            brain. “This has the potential to solve several brain-related
            diseases. The idea is to understand and treat brain disorders,
            preserve and enhance your own brain and create a well-aligned
            future,” Musk told the audience at the launch event last year. Musk
            founded Neuralink in 2016 but has only held one major public
            presentation.
